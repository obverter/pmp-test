A. The team members in question
B. The whole team
C. The project manager
D. The project champion


People - Task 2 - Lead a Team
Such problems should ideally be resolved by the team members themselves so long as the team and the work are not being affected. If that fails, the project manager will have to become more actively involved. The project champion is not necessarily part of the team but is someone who helps garner and sustain support for the project.

______
Question: 4
Correct - You answered: B

While completing your schedule model maintenance a team member informs you a stakeholder from another department has stopped sending updates, showing up to meetings, and has begun speaking negatively about the project openly. Based on the stakeholder's position and responsibilities, it is beginning to take a heavy toll on the project. What could the project manager have done to prevent this?



A. Documented this risk in the risk register along with potential responses
B. Conducted a stakeholder analysis and monitored stakeholder engagement mor losely
C. Created a communication management plan that would alert them sooner when takeholder was becoming resistant
D. Pulled the stakeholder aside and mentor them


Process - Task 4 - Engage Stakeholders
A stakeholder analysis would have identified their power, interest, and/or influence on the project allowing the project manager to determine the proper engagement level. Monitoring the stakeholder's engagement would have increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the engagement strategies, which are generally determined, in part, by the engagement level of stakeholders. Documenting the stakeholder on the risk register would be more reactionary. The communication management plan is the wrong document use here.

Your company's Human Resources department wants to create a new web front end to its benefits system to enable all employees to register for health insurance and other benefits for the upcoming new calendar year. Since the technology is fairly new to the company and time is short, management wants to run the project in an agile fashion, since running it in a predictive fashion will take too long and will miss the registration deadline by several weeks. As the assigned project manager, you are familiar with agile but most of your team is not. Management wants the project completed in 3 weeks, and you have 6 weeks between now and the project deadline. What should you do next?

A. Bring in outside agile consultants to help manage the project
B. Provide coaching and mentoring in agile concepts for all team members
C. Inform management that since there is insufficient agile expertise, that th roject should be run in a predictive fashion
D. Arrange for formal agile training for all team members


People - Task 5 - Ensure Team is Trained
While answer B is a component of servant leadership and will almost certainly be needed for his project, the best thing to do next is arrange for formal agile training for the team. Answer A is likely to be more expensive, and should only be done as a last resort (e.g., you can't get the agile training done in the time available before the project must start). Answer C isn't a viable option because it will miss the enrollment deadline by several weeks.

Question: 15
Correct - You answered: B

You are a project manager of a project close to completing the delivery of the final product when an important stakeholder contacts you about a requirement that seems to be missing from the project scope. You schedule a meeting with them to discuss the specifics of the requirement and the possible options for handling it. During the meeting, the conversation becomes somewhat heated when the stakeholder demands to know when the requirement will be completed. What is the ideal way to handle this situation?


A. Use the conflict resolution technique of Smoothing to examine the alternatives and identify a win-win solution
B. Explain that any details on whether the requirement is approved or might be completed would be made by the Change Control Board (CCB) and assist them in completing a change request.
C. Recognize the stakeholder as a resistor and leave the meeting room to avoid further conflict with a stakeholder
D. Agree to personally handle their request to ensure that it is completed as soon as possible to avoid any further conflict


People - Task 10 - Build Shared Understanding
The Change Control Board (CCB) must review and approve all change requests. Explaining this fact and then assisting with the completion of the change request is the best way to handle this. The technique of smoothing does not involve examining alternatives and is not win-win. Withdrawing during a conflict is never the best option. Agreeing to personally handle the request and to ensure it's completed as soon as possible sets an unrealistic expectation that it is already approved.

You are collecting requirements from all stakeholders during a planning meeting when stakeholders start having conflicting requirements. During the meeting tensions began to rise and people become disruptive to the meeting. The project manager decided to end the meeting earlier than scheduled to maintain relationships. The meeting was rescheduled for the next business day. What is the best way to proceed?


A. Conduct a brainstorming session and establish ground rules
B. Establish ground rules and begin discussions again
C. Establish ground rules and use the Monte Carlo technique to collect requirements silently
D. Establish ground rules, then use an affinity diagram to collect requirements followed by discrete voting applications


People - Task 10 - Build Shared Understanding
Establishing ground rules is a good practice, but without enforcement they are useless. Brainstorming could lead to the same results even with ground rules. Monte Carlo is a software application that calculates probability. An affinity diagram can be used as a silent information gathering technique that can be used with silent voting to prioritize requirements.

You are managing a project that will move your company's data to a new state-of-the-art data center. The biggest risk your team has identified is the risk of losing important customer records data during the move. Fortunately, most of the data is also stored on paper forms. However the cost to input the records would be very high. To address this risk you create a backup of the entire customer database as of last week, and purchase an insurance policy to pay for the cost to input data for the past 7 days. Which types of risk response strategies are you using?

A. Mitigate and transfer
B. Mitigate and enhance
C. Mitigate and share
D. Mitigate and avoid


Process - Task 3 - Manage Risks
Creating a backup of the data is an example of mitigation. Mitigation in this context is a plan you'll implement if things go wrong, to make sure the impact is minimized. The insurance policy is an example of transfer. The risk of the cost to input that data is being transferred to a third party. PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition (2017) PMI/PMI/11.5.2.4

You are the project manager for a large pharmaceutical company that recently partnered with another organization that reduces packaging costs for your organization under the auspice of a cost-reimbursable contract. After a risk workshop meeting, you find out two team members do not agree on a proposed solution for a risk to cost. You decide to let them come to a resolution on their own, but you document it on the issue log. What conflict management technique did you implement?


A. Direct/Force
B. Retreat/Avoid
C. Compromise/Reconcile
D. Withdraw/Avoid


People - Task 1 - Manage Conflict
Withdraw/Avoid is retreating from the conflict. The project manager is allowing the team members to resolve the issue themselves. By putting it on the issue log they are ensuring they will follow up on the conflict to make sure it is resolved.

Question: 82
Incorrect - You answered: C

A project manager is uncertain about the duration of a new product development project and consults several groups of subject matter experts (SMEs). They advise that the fastest development could possibly be finished is in 8 days. However, they have also identified some risks that could make the duration up to 32 days. Realistically, using standard development methods, the project should take 14 days. The team agrees that this final estimate is the most likely to occur and should be weighted by 4x accordingly. What is the estimated development duration for the new product?


A. 12
B. 16
C. 18
D. 20


Process - Task 5 - Manage Budget and Resources
Using the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) method of three-point estimating, the formula is (Optimistic + (4 X Most Likely) + Pessimistic)/6 = (8 + (4*14) + 32)/6 = 16 days. PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition (2017) PMI/PMI/7.2.2.5 Three-Point Estimating/p. 245

Which of the following would not be a typical benefit of using agile?


A. Improved quality from more frequent reviews
B. Requirements are allowed to change to better match business needs on a rolling basis
C. Greater accountability and productivity of empowered teams
D. Increased focus on business value based on prioritization of requirements


People - Task 13 - Mentor Stakeholders
While a self organizing empowered team is a crucial part of agile, this is one of the areas that predictive management often struggles with due to a lack of trust or feeling of not being involved the same way as before. Each of the other elements directly ties to business value and can usually be accepted more quickly. The Agile Practice Guide (2017) PMI/PMI/3.1 Characteristics of Project Life Cycles/pp. 18-19

B. 2, 3, and 5
C. 2, 4, and 6
D. 1, 3, and 5


People - Task 5 - Ensure Team is Trained

You are managing a project that will produce the next new supercomputer. As each new unit is produced your team is taking measurements and recording them in a control chart. Which of the following results should you be least concerned with?


A. A data point that is just above the upper control limit
B. Seven consecutive data points above the mean, but within the control limits
C. A data point that is just below the lower control limit
D. Several data points falling well above and below the mean, but within the control limits


Process - Task 7 - Manage Quality
Choice D is describing a random pattern of measurements that fall on either side of the mean. This is not a cause for concern to the project manager. Choice B, where 7 points fall consecutively on one side of the mean, should be of concern since this means your process is out of control. Choices A and C are both problems as well, since both represent data points that fall outside the control limits (meaning the process is out of control).

Two of your team members are arguing over a technical issue on your project. You suggest that they put their differences aside and offer to take them both to lunch. Which conflict resolution technique did you use?


A. Withdrawal
B. Compromise
C. Smoothing
D. Collaborating


People - Task 1 - Manage Conflict
This is an example of smoothing, which occurs when you try to gloss over the issue or change the subject. As a good project manager this is not your best option, because the problem still exists and will likely come up again. The better option would have been to collaborate, which would involve sitting down, discussing options, and trying to solve the problem. Withdrawal is where one party shuts down or walks away from the conversation. Compromise is where both parties give something up and meet in the middle.

Your company recently partnered with an overseas organization that specializes in wireless nanobots that are used to detect tumors during surgery. Report deadlines are constantly missed due to the difference in time zones. They claim to lose a day of work weekly due to the reporting dates documented in the communication management plan. As a project manager, what is the best solution for this?

A. Update the communications management plan to reflect a time zone that favors both organizations
B. Terminate the contract for non-conformance and select the next bidder on your procurement list
C. Inform them of the established process in the communication management plan and counsel them appropriately
D. Document it in the issue log and allow them time to adjust the schedule


People - Task 11 - Virtual Teams
Time zones are a consistent problem with virtual teams. Establishing a time zone that works in favor of both teams is the best approach. Terminating the agreement will cause the company to lose all of the benefits it gained. They already know what is contained in the plan and that is the cause of the issue. Documenting it in the issue log is too late and will not fix the issue.

You are the project manager of a large global project that has team members spread out across several countries in multiple time zones. Several of the team members in India have been complaining about the limited health benefits provided by your company and that they are not able to pay for the care they need, given their lower salaries as compared to project team members in the United States. Lately, they have been somewhat slow to respond to your e-mail requests for status updates and have even missed a few meetings. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this?


A. McGregor's Theory-X
B. Herzberg's Theory of Motivation
C. McGregor's Theory-Y
D. McClelland's Theory of Needs


People - Task 11 - Virtual Teams
Herzberg theorized pay and benefits do not lead to positive satisfaction for the long-term. But if these factors are absent or non-existent at the workplace, then they lead to dissatisfaction. McGregor's Theory-X and Theory-Y theorize that employees inherently dislike work and are self-motivated, respectively. McClelland's Theory of Needs says people are motivated by either 1) achievement, 2) affiliation, or 3) power.

As the new project manager for the Better Beach Bicycle Company, you and the project team are reviewing the work breakdown structure (WBS) which was created by the previous project team. After the project was postponed indefinitely, the previous project manager and project team were released. You notice that the lowest level nodes of the work breakdown structure (WBS) do not include a list of activities. Which of the following are true? 1 - You realize that the previous project team did not finish the work breakdown structure (WBS) since it should have included the required activities. 2 - This is OK since the lowest level of the work breakdown structure (WBS) should be the work package level. 3 - You realize that the previous project team may have captured the required activities in another document and you should keep reviewing their work. 4 - You realize that the previous project team did not finish the work breakdown structure (WBS) since it should have included the required resources. 5 - This is OK since the previous team was using rolling-wave planning, therefore the lowest level of the work breakdown structure (WBS) is the work package level.

A. 1 and 3
B. 2 and 3
C. 2 and 4
D. 4 and 5


Process - Task 8 - Manage Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition down to the work package level. A work breakdown structure (WBS) never includes resources or activities lists. Rolling-wave planning can be done after completing the work breakdown structure (WBS) but is not necessarily used to create one.

You are managing a large software project for a bank and are about 50% done with the work when a new stakeholder is identified. It turns out the stakeholder will be highly impacted by the new software project. You have a tight deadline and the requirements are already firmly set. What should you do?


A. Ignore the stakeholder
B. Meet with the stakeholder to inform her of your project
C. Meet with the stakeholder to gather her requirements
D. Find someone to blame for not identifying the stakeholder earlier


People - Task 9 - Collaborate with Stakeholders
The correct course of action would be to meet with the stakeholder and document her requirements. If time permits and the change is approved, you may still be able to incorporate her requirements. At the very least, you have engaged the stakeholder and attempted to satisfy her needs. Simply informing the stakeholder of your project and not gathering her requirements, as suggested in choice B, would not be appropriate either.

You have noticed that a few of your team members have personal animosity against each other, but it has not hindered their performance or affected the team. Who is responsible for addressing this problem in the first instance?

A. The team members in question
B. The whole team
C. The project manager
D. The project champion


People - Task 2 - Lead a Team
Such problems should ideally be resolved by the team members themselves so long as the team and the work are not being affected.

While completing your schedule model maintenance a team member informs you a stakeholder from another department has stopped sending updates, showing up to meetings, and has begun speaking negatively about the project openly. Based on the stakeholder's position and responsibilities, it is beginning to take a heavy toll on the project. What could the project manager have done to prevent this?


A. Documented this risk in the risk register along with potential responses
B. Conducted a stakeholder analysis and monitored stakeholder engagement more closely
C. Created a communication management plan that would alert them sooner when a stakeholder was becoming resistant
D. Pulled the stakeholder aside and mentor them


Process - Task 4 - Engage Stakeholders
A stakeholder analysis would have identified their power, interest, and/or influence on the project allowing the project manager to determine the proper engagement level.         Monitoring the stakeholder's engagement would have increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the engagement strategies, which are generally determined, in part, by the engagement level of stakeholders. Documenting the stakeholder on the risk register would be more reactionary. The communication management plan is the wrong document use here.

Your company's Human Resources department wants to create a new web front end to its benefits system to enable all employees to register for health insurance and other benefits for the upcoming new calendar year. Since the technology is fairly new to the company and time is short, management wants to run the project in an agile fashion, since running it in a predictive fashion will take too long and will miss the registration deadline by several weeks. As the assigned project manager, you are familiar with agile but most of your team is not. Management wants the project completed in 3 weeks, and you have 6 weeks between now and the project deadline.         What should you do next?


A. Bring in outside agile consultants to help manage the project
B. Provide coaching and mentoring in agile concepts for all team members
C. Inform management that since there is insufficient agile expertise,                 that the project should be run in a predictive fashion
D. Arrange for formal agile training for all team members


People - Task 5 - Ensure Team is Trained
While answer B is a component of servant leadership and will almost certainly be needed for his project, the best thing to do next is arrange for formal agile training for the team.

You schedule a meeting with them to discuss the specifics of the requirement and the possible options for handling it. During the meeting, the conversation becomes somewhat heated when the stakeholder demands to know when the requirement will be completed. What is the ideal way to handle this situation?


A. Use the conflict resolution technique of Smoothing to examine the alternatives and identify a win-win solution
B. Explain that any details on whether the requirement is approved or might be completed would be made by the Change Control Board (CCB) and assist them in completing a change request.
C. Recognize the stakeholder as a resistor and leave the meeting room to avoid further conflict with a stakeholder
D. Agree to personally handle their request to ensure that it is completed as soon as possible to avoid any further conflict


People - Task 10 - Build Shared Understanding
The Change Control Board (CCB) must review and approve all change requests.         Explaining this fact and then assisting with the completion of the change request is the best way to handle this. The technique of smoothing does not involve examining alternatives and is not win-win.         Withdrawing during a conflict is never the best option.

You are collecting requirements from all stakeholders during a planning meeting when stakeholders start having conflicting requirements. During the meeting tensions began to rise and people become disruptive to the meeting. The project manager decided to end the meeting earlier than scheduled to maintain relationships. The meeting was rescheduled for the next business day. What is the best way to proceed?


A. Conduct a brainstorming session and establish ground rules
B. Establish ground rules and begin discussions again
C. Establish ground rules and use the Monte Carlo technique to collect requirements silently
D. Establish ground rules, then use an affinity diagram to collect requirements followed by discrete voting applications


People - Task 10 - Build Shared Understanding
Establishing ground rules is a good practice, but without enforcement they are useless. Brainstorming could lead to the same results even with ground rules. Monte Carlo is a software application that calculates probability. An affinity diagram can be used as a silent information gathering technique that can be used with silent voting to prioritize requirements.

You are managing a project that will move your company's data to a new state-of-the-art data center. The biggest risk your team has identified is the risk of losing important customer records data during the move. Fortunately, most of the data is also stored on paper forms. However the cost to input the records would be very high. To address this risk you create a backup of the entire customer database as of last week, and purchase an insurance policy to pay for the cost to input data for the past 7 days. Which types of risk response strategies are you using?

A. Mitigate and transfer
B. Mitigate and enhance
C. Mitigate and share
D. Mitigate and avoid

After a risk workshop meeting, you find out two team members do not agree on a proposed solution for a risk to cost. You decide to let them come to a resolution on their own, but you document it on the issue log. What conflict management technique did you implement?


A. Direct/Force
B. Retreat/Avoid
C. Compromise/Reconcile
D. Withdraw/Avoid


People - Task 1 - Manage Conflict
Withdraw/Avoid is retreating from the conflict. The project manager is allowing the team members to resolve the issue themselves. By putting it on the issue log they are ensuring they will follow up on the conflict to make sure it is resolved.

A project manager is uncertain about the duration of a new product development project and consults several groups of subject matter experts (SMEs). They advise that the fastest development could possibly be finished is in 8 days. However, they have also identified some risks that could make the duration up to 32 days. Realistically, using standard development methods, the project should take 14 days. The team agrees that this final estimate is the most likely to occur and should be weighted by 4x accordingly. What is the estimated development duration for the new product?


A. 12
B. 16
C. 18
D. 20


Process - Task 5 - Manage Budget and Resources
Using the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) method of three-point estimating, the formula is (Optimistic + (4 X Most Likely) + Pessimistic)/6 = (8 +         (4*14) + 32)/6 = 16 days. PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition (2017) PMI/PMI/7.2.2.5 Three-Point Estimating/p.         245

Your project is using an incremental approach and this will have no impact on it. What would be your best response?


A. Document this on the issue log for future projects
B. Discuss with them how agile is best used for projects with a high-uncertainty of work and frequent change
C. Tell them it is only used for software development projects and will never impact us
D. Laugh it off so you don't offend them


People - Task 13 - Mentor Stakeholders
Take advantage of this opportunity to mentor them on the benefits of agile and the types of projects that would benefit the most from it. An issue log is a document for ongoing projects. The agile approach is not limited to software development, but can be used by teachers, doctors, lawyers, and problem solving engineers.

You are managing a project to build a bridge across the bay.         The previous project had cost overruns because the project team underestimated the winds and harsh weather conditions on the bay. From which of the following should you derive this historical information?

A. Organizational process assets (OPA)
B. The National Weather Service historical database
C. Project management software
D. Enterprise environmental factors (EEF)


Process - Task 5 - Manage Budget and Resources
The lessons learned documentation from the prior project is part of the organizational process assets (OPA). The national weather service does have a historical database,         but the question is asking about previous projects. Project management software is a tool that can be part of the project management information system (PMIS). Enterprise environmental factors (EEF)         are the factors surrounding your workplace and are usually intangible, which the windy conditions are an example. However, the information documenting this is part of your OPA. PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition (2017) PMI/PMI/2.3 Organizational Process Assets/pp. 39-41

A. Withdrawal
B. Compromise
C. Smoothing
D. Collaborating


People - Task 1 - Manage Conflict
This is an example of smoothing, which occurs when you try to gloss over the issue or change the subject.

Your company recently partnered with an overseas organization that specializes in wireless nanobots that are used to detect tumors during surgery. Report deadlines are constantly missed due to the difference in time zones. They claim to lose a day of work weekly due to the reporting dates documented in the communication management plan. As a project manager, what is the best solution for this?

A. Update the communications management plan to reflect a time zone that favors both organizations
B. Terminate the contract for non-conformance and select the next bidder on your procurement list
C. Inform them of the established process in the communication management plan and counsel them appropriately
D. Document it in the issue log and allow them time to adjust the schedule


People - Task 11 - Virtual Teams
Time zones are a consistent problem with virtual teams. Establishing a time zone that works in favor of both teams is the best approach.

A. Ignore the stakeholder
B. Meet with the stakeholder to inform her of your project
C. Meet with the stakeholder to gather her requirements
D. Find someone to blame for not identifying the stakeholder earlier


People - Task 9 - Collaborate with Stakeholders
The correct course of action would be to meet with the stakeholder and document her requirements. If time permits and the change is approved, you may still be able to incorporate her requirements. At the very least, you have engaged the stakeholder and attempted to satisfy her needs. Simply informing the stakeholder of your project and not gathering her requirements, as suggested in choice B, would not be appropriate either.

        Incorrect - You answered: B )

You are a project manager in the Information Technology department. Your company is new to agile concepts, and while most of your department is familiar with and on board with agile, most of the business units are not. Since key stakeholders will now become part of agile teams, you realize that you will need to mentor and coach them during sprints to help "sell" them on the benefits of agile to help keep them properly engaged. Which of the following would not be a typical benefit of using agile?


A. Improved quality from more frequent reviews
B. Requirements are allowed to change to better match business needs on a rolling basis
C. Greater accountability and productivity of empowered teams
D. Increased focus on business value based on prioritization of requirements


People - Task 13 - Mentor Stakeholders
While a self organizing empowered team is a crucial part of agile, this is one of the areas that predictive management often struggles with due to a lack of trust or feeling of not being involved the same way as before. Each of the other elements directly ties to business value and can usually be accepted more quickly.

You are managing a project that will produce the next new supercomputer. As each new unit is produced your team is taking measurements and recording them in a control chart. Which of the following results should you be least concerned with?


A. A data point that is just above the upper control limit
B. Seven consecutive data points above the mean, but within the control limits
C. A data point that is just below the lower control limit
D. Several data points falling well above and below the mean, but within the control limits


Process - Task 7 - Manage Quality
Choice D is describing a random pattern of measurements that fall on either side of the mean. This is not a cause for concern to the project manager. Choice B, where 7 points fall consecutively on one side of the mean, should be of concern since this means your process is out of control. Choices A and C are both problems as well, since both represent data points that fall outside the control limits (meaning the process is out of control).

Two of your team members are arguing over a technical issue on your project. You suggest that they put their differences aside and offer to take them both to lunch. Which conflict resolution technique did you use?

A. Withdrawal
B. Compromise
C. Smoothing
D. Collaborating


People - Task 1 - Manage Conflict
This is an example of smoothing, which occurs when you try to gloss over the issue or change the subject. As a good project manager this is not your best option, because the problem still exists and will likely come up again. The better option would have been to collaborate, which would involve sitting down, discussing options, and trying to solve the problem.         Withdrawal is where one party shuts down or walks away from the conversation. Compromise is where both parties give something up and meet in the middle.

You are managing a large software project for a bank and are about 50% done with the work when a new stakeholder is identified. It turns out the stakeholder will be highly impacted by the new software project. You have a tight deadline and the requirements are already firmly set. What should you do?


A. Ignore the stakeholder
B. Meet with the stakeholder to inform her of your project
C. Meet with the stakeholder to gather her requirements
D. Find someone to blame for not identifying the stakeholder earlier


People - Task 9 - Collaborate with Stakeholders
The correct course of action would be to meet with the stakeholder and document her requirements. If time permits and the change is approved, you may still be able to incorporate her requirements. At the very least, you have engaged the stakeholder and attempted to satisfy her needs. Simply informing the stakeholder of your project and not gathering her requirements, as suggested in choice B, would not be appropriate either.

A $3.2 million contract has been awarded to your company and you have been identified as the project manager. During a review of the project charter with the sponsor you both determine additional training is required. There are 12 people on your team and the finance department only has enough to fund training for half of the team. As the project manager,         how should you proceed?


A. Use the allotted funds to transfer the risk using a firm fixed-price contract
B. Write a justification to request more funds
C. Use funds from the baseline to pay the additional costs

A. The team members in question
B. The whole team
C. The project manager
D. The project champion


People - Task 2 - Lead a Team
Such problems should ideally be resolved by the team members themselves so long as the team and the work are not being affected.

While completing your schedule model maintenance a team member informs you a stakeholder from another department has stopped sending updates, showing up to meetings, and has begun speaking negatively about the project openly. Based on the stakeholder's position and responsibilities, it is beginning to take a heavy toll on the project. What could the project manager have done to prevent this?


A. Documented this risk in the risk register along with potential responses
B. Conducted a stakeholder analysis and monitored stakeholder engagement more closely
C. Created a communication management plan that would alert them sooner when a stakeholder was becoming resistant
D. Pulled the stakeholder aside and mentor them


Process - Task 4 - Engage Stakeholders
A stakeholder analysis would have identified their power, interest, and/or influence on the project allowing the project manager to determine the proper engagement level.         Monitoring the stakeholder's engagement would have increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the engagement strategies, which are generally determined, in part, by the engagement level of stakeholders. Documenting the stakeholder on the risk register would be more reactionary. The communication management plan is the wrong document use here.

You are a project manager of a project close to completing the delivery of the final product when an important stakeholder contacts you about a requirement that seems to be missing from the project scope. You schedule a meeting with them to discuss the specifics of the requirement and the possible options for handling it. During the meeting, the conversation becomes somewhat heated when the stakeholder demands to know when the requirement will be completed. What is the ideal way to handle this situation?


A. Use the conflict resolution technique of Smoothing to examine the alternatives and identify a win-win solution
B. Explain that any details on whether the requirement is approved or might be completed would be made by the Change Control Board (CCB) and assist them in completing a change request.
C. Recognize the stakeholder as a resistor and leave the meeting room to avoid further conflict with a stakeholder
D. Agree to personally handle their request to ensure that it is completed as soon as possible to avoid any further conflict


People - Task 10 - Build Shared Understanding
The Change Control Board (CCB) must review and approve all change requests.         Explaining this fact and then assisting with the completion of the change request is the best way to handle this. The technique of smoothing does not involve examining alternatives and is not win-win.         Withdrawing during a conflict is never the best option. Agreeing to personally handle the request and to ensure it's completed as soon as possible sets an unrealistic expectation that it is already approved.

The project schedule network diagram displays the relationships among activities, and would therefore be the most helpful in determining the total duration of the project. The schedule management plan would tell you how to go about schedule planning, but it would not contain information about project duration. The work breakdown structure (WBS) and scope statement would contain information about project scope, but lack sufficient detail about individual activities to determine the project duration.

Your organization recently decided to change from a predictive methodology to agile. During a budget meeting, a colleague does not understand why we have to use this new approach and terminology. They state they will continue to use old definitions and terms to maintain clear communication. As a project manager, what should you do?

A. Explain the new terminology reminds team members to use the new methodology and promotes change
B. Explain that management will most likely forget about this change in a month or two
C. Do nothing, because they do not work for you
D. Inform the company executive who is driving the transition so that they can champion the transition with your colleague.


Business Environment - Task 4 - Support Org Change
When companies do not change their definitions they are more likely to revert to the old ways of doing things. The agile terminology enforces change, but it must be enforced by the leadership. The Agile Practice Guide (2017) PMI/PMI/Table X2-1 Tailoring Considerations/p. 123

On your project, a deliverable was recently created but had to be reworked due to a defect. You traced the root cause to an employee who was operating off an old version of the project management plan. As a project manager, how should you proceed?


A. Fire the employee for not following protocol
B. Show the employee where to find the most up-to-date copy of the plan and verify they are receiving updates
C. Verify the employee is receiving notifications from the project management information system (PMIS) of any changed plans according to the change control board (CCB)
D. Conduct training with all team members


Process - Task 12 - Manage Artifacts
As the project manager, you want to ensure the employee is receiving updates and they know how and where to retrieve them from. Terminating the employee is an extreme measure that will add risk to your project. The change control board (CCB) does not dictate version control,         they approve or reject changes. Conducting training for the entire team is a vague statement that may not identify the root cause of the problem.

You are managing a project that will move your company's data to a new state-of-the-art data center. The biggest risk your team has identified is the risk of losing important customer records data during the move. Fortunately, most of the data is also stored on paper forms. However the cost to input the records would be very high. To address this risk you create a backup of the entire customer database as of last week, and purchase an insurance policy to pay for the cost to input data for the past 7 days. Which types of risk response strategies are you using?

A. Mitigate and transfer
B. Mitigate and enhance
C. Mitigate and share
D. Mitigate and avoid


Process - Task 3 - Manage Risks
Creating a backup of the data is an example of mitigation. Mitigation in this context is a plan you'll implement if things go wrong, to make sure the impact is minimized.

Your company recently partnered with an overseas organization that specializes in wireless nanobots that are used to detect tumors during surgery. Report deadlines are constantly missed due to the difference in time zones. They claim to lose a day of work weekly due to the reporting dates documented in the communication management plan. As a project manager, what is the best solution for this?

A. Update the communications management plan to reflect a time zone that favors both organizations
B. Terminate the contract for non-conformance and select the next bidder on your procurement list

You are the project manager of a large global project that has team members spread out across several countries in multiple time zones. Several of the team members in India have been complaining about the limited health benefits provided by your company and that they are not able to pay for the care they need, given their lower salaries as compared to project team members in the United States. Lately, they have been somewhat slow to respond to your e-mail requests for status updates and have even missed a few meetings. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this?


A. McGregor's Theory-X
B. Herzberg's Theory of Motivation
C. McGregor's Theory-Y
D. McClelland's Theory of Needs


People - Task 11 - Virtual Teams
Herzberg theorized pay and benefits do not lead to positive satisfaction for the long-term. But if these factors are absent or non-existent at the workplace, then they lead to dissatisfaction. McGregor's Theory-X and Theory-Y theorize that employees inherently dislike work and are self-motivated, respectively. McClelland's Theory of Needs says people are motivated by either 1) achievement, 2) affiliation, or 3) power.

As the new project manager for the Better Beach Bicycle Company, you and the project team are reviewing the work breakdown structure (WBS) which was created by the previous project team. After the project was postponed indefinitely, the previous project manager and project team were released. You notice that the lowest level nodes of the work breakdown structure (WBS) do not include a list of activities. Which of the following are true?         1 - You realize that the previous project team did not finish the work breakdown structure (WBS)         since it should have included the required activities.         2 - This is OK since the lowest level of the work breakdown structure (WBS) should be the work package level.         3 - You realize that the previous project team may have captured the required activities in another document and you should keep reviewing their work.         4 - You realize that the previous project team did not finish the work breakdown structure (WBS)         since it should have included the required resources.         5 - This is OK since the previous team was using rolling-wave planning, therefore the lowest level of the work breakdown structure (WBS) is the work package level.


A. 1 and 3
B. 2 and 3
C. 2 and 4
D. 4 and 5


Process - Task 8 - Manage Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition down to the work package level. A work breakdown structure (WBS) never includes resources or activities lists.         Rolling-wave planning can be done after completing the work breakdown structure (WBS) but is not necessarily used to create one. There is also no indication in the question that the previous team used rolling-wave planning. PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition (2017) PMI/PMI/5.4 Create WBS/p. 157

B. The whole team
C. The project manager
D. The project champion


People - Task 2 - Lead a Team
Such problems should ideally be resolved by the team members themselves so long as the team and the work are not being affected.

While completing your schedule model maintenance a team member informs you a stakeholder from another department has stopped sending updates, showing up to meetings, and has begun speaking negatively about the project openly. Based on the stakeholder's position and responsibilities, it is beginning to take a heavy toll on the project. What could the project manager have done to prevent this?



A. Documented this risk in the risk register along with potential responses
B. Conducted a stakeholder analysis and monitored stakeholder engagement more closely
C. Created a communication management plan that would alert them sooner when a stakeholder was becoming resistant
D. Pulled the stakeholder aside and mentor them


Process - Task 4 - Engage Stakeholders
A stakeholder analysis would have identified their power, interest, and/or influence on the project allowing the project manager to determine the proper engagement level. Monitoring the stakeholder's engagement would have increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the engagement strategies, which are generally determined, in part, by the engagement level of stakeholders. Documenting the stakeholder on the risk register would be more reactionary. The communication management plan is the wrong document use here.

Since the technology is fairly new to the company and time is short, management wants to run the project in an agile fashion, since running it in a predictive fashion will take too long and will miss the registration deadline by several weeks. As the assigned project manager, you are familiar with agile but most of your team is not. Management wants the project completed in 3 weeks, and you have 6 weeks between now and the project deadline. What should you do next?


A. Bring in outside agile consultants to help manage the project
B. Provide coaching and mentoring in agile concepts for all team members
C. Inform management that since there is insufficient agile expertise, that the project should be run in a predictive fashion
D. Arrange for formal agile training for all team members


People - Task 5 - Ensure Team is Trained
While answer B is a component of servant leadership and will almost certainly be needed for his project, the best thing to do next is arrange for formal agile training for the team. Answer A is likely to be more expensive, and should only be done as a last resort (e.g., you can't get the agile training done in the time available before the project must start). Answer C isn't a viable option because it will miss the enrollment deadline by several weeks.

You are a project manager of a project close to completing the delivery of the final product when an important stakeholder contacts you about a requirement that seems to be missing from the project scope. You schedule a meeting with them to discuss the specifics of the requirement and the possible options for handling it. During the meeting, the conversation becomes somewhat heated when the stakeholder demands to know when the requirement will be completed. What is the ideal way to handle this situation?

A. Use the conflict resolution technique of Smoothing to examine the alternatives and identify a win-win solution
B. Explain that any details on whether the requirement is approved or might be completed would be made by the Change Control Board (CCB) and assist them in completing a change request.
C. Recognize the stakeholder as a resistor and leave the meeting room to avoid further conflict with a stakeholder
D. Agree to personally handle their request to ensure that it is completed as soon as possible to avoid any further conflict


People - Task 10 - Build Shared Understanding
The Change Control Board (CCB) must review and approve all change requests. Explaining this fact and then assisting with the completion of the change request is the best way to handle this. The technique of smoothing does not involve examining alternatives and is not win-win. Withdrawing during a conflict is never the best option. Agreeing to personally handle the request and to ensure it's completed as soon as possible sets an unrealistic expectation that it is already approved.

Which of the following would be most helpful in determining the total duration of your project?


A. Schedule Management Plan
B. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
C. Project Schedule Network Diagram
D. Scope Statement


Process - Task 6 - Manage Schedule
The project schedule network diagram displays the relationships among activities, and would therefore be the most helpful in determining the total duration of the project.

You have just been informed that you have been selected as the new project manager for the XYZ Widget project, which is on a very tight schedule. You recall that previous projects for this customer did not go as smoothly as planned with respect to both the budget and schedule so there is a lot of pressure to meet expectations on this new project. Which of the following should you do first?

A. Schedule a kick-off meeting to begin brainstorming with your project team to review the schedule and to understand any issues or concerns that may immediately arise
B. Ask for a copy of the project charter so you can review who the major stakeholders are, what the high level budget, schedule, and requirements are and verify your authority as the project manager
C. Immediately begin identifying requirements in order to get a jump on the schedule since your primary concern is ensuring that the expectations of the project and the customer are fully met this time
D. Review the project scope statement to ensure you fully understand all of the requirements and criteria for success and then schedule a meeting to begin identifying stakeholders


Process - Task 9 - Integrate Planning
A project is not officially authorized until the project charter has been created, so no other activities should be started until it has been created. Since you have already been identified as the new project manager, the project charter has already been created. The scope statement would not be created until after you have defined all of the requirements. PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition (2017) PMI/PMI/4.1.3.1 Project Charter/p. 81

During your last vacation you had some time to read up on some of the new and emerging management practices. You have realized that your team does a wide array of projects and there could be a few options to pick from when it comes to getting your best results, so you decide to call a meeting with the team. As everyone is coming together you strike up the conversation and realize that a bulk of your projects have a fixed scope which rarely changes and you deliver everything at the end of the project. One of your team members brings up an exception to that norm and feels that you should have gone with an agile approach on that particular project. According to the Continuum of Life Cycles, when is the agile methodology best suited?


A. When the frequency of delivery is high and degree of change is low
B. When the frequency of delivery is high and degree of change is high
C. When the frequency of delivery is low and degree of change is high

You are collecting requirements from all stakeholders during a planning meeting when stakeholders start having conflicting requirements. During the meeting tensions began to rise and people become disruptive to the meeting. The project manager decided to end the meeting earlier than scheduled to maintain relationships. The meeting was rescheduled for the next business day. What is the best way to proceed?


A. Conduct a brainstorming session and establish ground rules
B. Establish ground rules and begin discussions again
C. Establish ground rules and use the Monte Carlo technique to collect requirements silently
D. Establish ground rules, then use an affinity diagram to collect requirements followed by discrete voting applications


People - Task 10 - Build Shared Understanding
Establishing ground rules is a good practice, but without enforcement they are useless. Brainstorming could lead to the same results even with ground rules. Monte Carlo is a software application that calculates probability. An affinity diagram can be used as a silent information gathering technique that can be used with silent voting to prioritize requirements.

On your project, a deliverable was recently created but had to be reworked due to a defect. You traced the root cause to an employee who was operating off an old version of the project management plan. As a project manager, how should you proceed?


A. Fire the employee for not following protocol
B. Show the employee where to find the most up-to-date copy of the plan and verify they are receiving updates
C. Verify the employee is receiving notifications from the project management information system (PMIS) of any changed plans according to the change control board (CCB)
D. Conduct training with all team members


Process - Task 12 - Manage Artifacts
As the project manager, you want to ensure the employee is receiving updates and they know how and where to retrieve them from. Terminating the employee is an extreme measure that will add risk to your project. The change control board (CCB) does not dictate version control, they approve or reject changes. Conducting training for the entire team is a vague statement that may not identify the root cause of the problem.

You are managing a project that will move your company's data to a new state-of-the-art data center. The biggest risk your team has identified is the risk of losing important customer records data during the move. Fortunately, most of the data is also stored on paper forms. However the cost to input the records would be very high. To address this risk you create a backup of the entire customer database as of last week, and purchase an insurance policy to pay for the cost to input data for the past 7 days. Which types of risk response strategies are you using?

A. Mitigate and transfer
B. Mitigate and enhance
C. Mitigate and share
D. Mitigate and avoid


Process - Task 3 - Manage Risks
Creating a backup of the data is an example of mitigation. Mitigation in this context is a plan you'll implement if things go wrong, to make sure the impact is minimized. The insurance policy is an example of transfer. The risk of the cost to input that data is being transferred to a third party. PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition (2017) PMI/PMI/11.5.2.4

Your talking to a friend about joining their company, and really like the sound to the collaboration between their project and functional managers. What types of organization structure does this refer to? 1 - Balanced Matrix 2 - Weak Matrix 3 - Functional 4 - Project-oriented 5 - Adaptive


A. 4 and 5
B. 1 and 4
C. 2 and 3
D. 1 and 3


Process - Task 13 - Determine Methodology
In a project-oriented (sometimes called projectized or composite/hybrid) organizational structure the project team reports to only one boss and is tasked with working solely on the one project. One major problem with this type of structure is what to do with the team members when the project is completed. One way this is handled is to terminate the employment of all team members. With balanced matrix organizations functional and project managers have shared authority and much collaborate in order to be effective.

Your organization specializes in making, selling, and shipping steel used to build skyscrapers in major cities across the United States. Your shipments of steel are sent monthly based on a firm fixed-price contract with economic price adjustments (EPA). The end of the fiscal year is approaching and a new contract has just been negotiated to account for EPA. You later find out new tariffs are placed against steel and the cost to manufacture and ship steel skyrocket. Your customers will most likely do what is most cost-effective for them and leave your organization. What is the best way this could have been avoided?

Your company recently partnered with an overseas organization that specializes in wireless nanobots that are used to detect tumors during surgery. Report deadlines are constantly missed due to the difference in time zones. They claim to lose a day of work weekly due to the reporting dates documented in the communication management plan. As a project manager, what is the best solution for this?

A. Update the communications management plan to reflect a time zone that favors both organizations
B. Terminate the contract for non-conformance and select the next bidder on your procurement list
C. Inform them of the established process in the communication management plan and counsel them appropriately
D. Document it in the issue log and allow them time to adjust the schedule


People - Task 11 - Virtual Teams
Time zones are a consistent problem with virtual teams. Establishing a time zone that works in favor of both teams is the best approach. Terminating the agreement will cause the company to lose all of the benefits it gained. They already know what is contained in the plan and that is the cause of the issue. Documenting it in the issue log is too late and will not fix the issue.

You are the project manager of a large global project that has team members spread out across several countries in multiple time zones. Several of the team members in India have been complaining about the limited health benefits provided by your company and that they are not able to pay for the care they need, given their lower salaries as compared to project team members in the United States. Lately, they have been somewhat slow to respond to your e-mail requests for status updates and have even missed a few meetings. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this?


A. McGregor's Theory-X
B. Herzberg's Theory of Motivation
C. McGregor's Theory-Y
D. McClelland's Theory of Needs


People - Task 11 - Virtual Teams
Herzberg theorized pay and benefits do not lead to positive satisfaction for the long-term. But if these factors are absent or non-existent at the workplace, then they lead to dissatisfaction.

You are managing a large software project for a bank and are about 50% done with the work when a new stakeholder is identified. It turns out the stakeholder will be highly impacted by the new software project. You have a tight deadline and the requirements are already firmly set. What should you do?


A. Ignore the stakeholder
B. Meet with the stakeholder to inform her of your project
C. Meet with the stakeholder to gather her requirements
D. Find someone to blame for not identifying the stakeholder earlier


People - Task 9 - Collaborate with Stakeholders
The correct course of action would be to meet with the stakeholder and document her requirements. If time permits and the change is approved, you may still be able to incorporate her requirements. At the very least, you have engaged the stakeholder and attempted to satisfy her needs. Simply informing the stakeholder of your project and not gathering her requirements, as suggested in choice B, would not be appropriate either.

A. Add the regulatory requirement to your requirements documentation
B. Meet with the project team to analyze how the change would impact other project objectives
C. Add the regulatory agency to your stakeholder register
D. Add this as a risk to your risk register


Business Environment - Task 1 - Manage Compliance
You are in the planning portion of the project, so you would add this as a regulatory requirement within your requirements documentation. While adding the regulatory agency to your stakeholder register and adding any new risks to the risk register is a good idea, you want to add the requirement to your requirements documentation as soon as possible. Choice B would imply you have already completed planning and would need to process a change request. When you are planning, there is no need for a change request. The change process is needed when baselines and the Project Management Plan have been approved, which is not the case here.

Hershel is creating the infrastructure for a new airline route from Hartford, CT to Edinburgh, Scotland, as his company is hoping to break into the British market. The project charter sets the limit of the cost of the round-trip flight to $500, in order to break even. This is significantly less than current competitors. Two months before entering the market, Hershel discovers a new European startup airline offers flights on the same route for $180 each way. What is the next step Hershel should take?


A. Stop current work and raise an issue with the sponsor since the project charter has been breached
B. Raise the out-of-scope issue at the next status meeting
C. Identify the impacts of lowering the price to a new competitive pricing
D. Inform the project sponsor and marketing team


Business Environment - Task 3 - Evaluate Scope Changes
The pricing and the decision to go forward has to be made at a higher level than the project team in this situation. Because Hershel is creating the infrastructure part of the project, raising this issue at a status meeting would not be sufficient. Since meeting the price of the competitor would breach the project charter constraint of $500, this must be escalated to senior management. Hershel should not stop the current work (answer A) because he does not know how senior management will answer. Therefore, answer D is the best answer, given the choices.

The expected value for your project duration estimate is 627 days, and the most likely duration estimate is 575. The standard deviation is 14. Which of the following statements is true?

A. A 95 percent confidence factor would make this project duration between 547         days and 603 days.
B. The project duration, given a 95 percent confidence factor, is between 613         days and 641 days.
C. The project duration, given a 99.7 percent confidence factor, is between 585         days and 669 days.
D. A 68 percent confidence factor would make this project duration between 547         days and 603 days.


Process - Task 6 - Manage Schedule
Do not be fooled by the mention of the most likely duration. We want the full duration estimate which was already calculated for us (O + 4(M) + P)/6. Next, assess the responses individually: A 99.7 percent confidence level is achieved by adding and subtracting three standard deviations to the expected value. Standard deviation is already provided to us (14 days). 3x14 = (+/-42 days). Therefore, the range of dates for this question is 585 days to 669 days or 627 +/-42 days.

You are the project manager on an agile team that has completed six out of a planned eight 2-week sprints that will make up the first release of your company's new automated project resource request system. Since there is only a month left to go before the system will be available for all end users in the company, you will need an Implementation/Rollout Plan. Which of the following items is typically not included in such a plan?


A. Training plan for end users
B. Product demonstration schedule
C. List of all end users by department and job function
D. Strategies for handling resistance to adoption and utilization of the new system


Business Environment - Task 4 - Support Org Change
How resistance to adoption and utilization will be handled is included in a (Organizational) Change Management Plan. This plan differs from the Change Management Plan that is a component of the Project Management Plan, which addresses how project or product change requests will be handled throughout the project life cycle. An Organizational Change Management Plan addresses how the organization deals with sponsorship, cultural, capacity, maturity and resistance issues. This is the people side of change which many project implementations trigger--especially when they dramatically change the way the company conducts its business, and people have to change their behaviors accordingly.


______
Question: 62
Incorrect - You answered: B

You are managing a project that is running behind schedule. You change the relationship of several scheduled activities from finish-to-start to start-to-start in order to complete the project within the deadline. This is an example of which of the following and what impact does it have on project risk?

A. Fast-tracking and will increase risk
B. Crashing and will increase risk
C. Adjusting leads and lags and will decrease risk
D. Resource leveling and will have no effect on risk


Process - Task 6 - Manage Schedule
Fast-tracking is when you take activities or project phases that would otherwise be done sequentially and do them in parallel. This speeds up delivery of the project, but will also increase risk. Crashing is when you add extra resources to critical path activities. Adjusting leads or lags does not alter the relationship of activities, but applies a delay or head-start to activities. Resource leveling is the process of smoothing out resource utilization to avoid spikes in resource demand.



______
Question: 63
Correct - You answered: B

As time passes in a project, which of the following does not happen?



A. Cost of change increases
B. Risk increases
C. Stakeholder influence decreases
D. Cumulative project spending increases


Process - Task 3 - Manage Risks
As time passes in a project the cost of change increases, risk decreases, and stakeholder influence decreases. Cost of change increases because as time passes if you make a change it will likely require rework. Risk decreases because as time passes you complete more work and thus your uncertainty goes down. Stakeholder influence decreases, because you gather information from stakeholders at the beginning of the project and as you go forward you are executing according to the plan rather than according to the whims of the stakeholders.


______
Question: 64
Correct - You answered: B

Unfortunately, your company is notorious for having a low level of confidence in activity duration estimates. To address this, you have worked with the PMO to devise a new method of gathering and providing duration estimates using standard deviation. Now working with your subject matter experts, you have started entering those estimates into your project activity list. For activity A, if your expected value is 120 and the standard deviation is 14, which of the following is true?


A. There is approximately a 99 percent chance of completing this activity in 96         to 144 days.
B. There is approximately a 68 percent chance of completing this activity in         106 to 134 days.
C. There is approximately a 95 percent chance of completing this activity in         106 to 134 days.
D. There is approximately a 75 percent chance of completing this activity in 94         to 146 days.


Process - Task 6 - Manage Schedule
A 68 percent probability is calculated using plus or minus one standard deviation (120 plus or minus 14 is 106 to 134), and a 95 percent probability uses plus or minus two standard deviations (120 plus or minus 14x2 or 28 = 92 to 148), an answer not given here). A 99 percent probability is not an option - you will be given 99.7 or 99.999, which is 3 and 6 standard deviations, respectively. A 75 percent probability is not an option either. You just need to know 68, 95, 99.7, and 99.999 for the exam, which are respectively 1, 2, 3, and 6 sigma.

Question: 65
Correct - You answered: A

A project sponsor is risk averse and is therefore concerned about negative impacts on the project. To help with this concern, the project team identifies four project risks and then evaluates both the probability of occurrence and the impact of the risk if it occurs. The team uses a 1-5 scale, 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Risk A has a probability of 3 and an impact of 5, Risk B probability of 4 and an impact of 2, Risk C probability of 3 and an impact of 3, and Risk D probability of 2 and an impact of 2. Based on these data, in what order should the project manager rank these risks for risk management purposes?

A. A, C, B, D
B. B, A, D, C
C. D, A, C, B
D. C, D, A, B


Process - Task 3 - Manage Risks
A) Probability * Impact provides the risk ranking from highest to lowest. A = 3*5 = 15. B = 4*2 = 8. C = 3*3 = 9. D = 2*2 = 4. Therefore the risks should be ranked in the following order: A, C, B, D, PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition (2017) PMI/PMI/11.4/428

Question: 67
Correct - You answered: B

You are managing a project with a total budget of $450,000. According to the schedule, your team should have completed 45% of the work by now. But at the latest status meeting, the team reported that only 40% of the work has actually been completed. The team has spent $165,000 so far on the project. How would you best describe this project?


A. The project is ahead of schedule and within its budget
B. The project is behind schedule and within its budget
C. The project is ahead of schedule and over its budget
D. The project is behind schedule and over its budget


Process - Task 6 - Manage Schedule
If you want to evaluate how the project is doing with respect to the schedule and budget, you need to calculate CPI and SPI. The first step is to write down the information you have so far: BAC = $450,000, planned % complete = 45%, actual % complete = 40% and AC = $165,000. Now you can calculate PV as follows: BAC x planned % complete = $450,000 x 45% = PV of $202,500. You then calculate EV as follows: BAC x actual % complete = $450,000 x 40% = $180,000. Now you have the information you need to calculate CPI and SPI. CPI = EV / AC, which in this case is: $180,000 / $165,000 = 1.09. Since CPI is 1.0 or higher, your project is within its budget. You then calculate SPI as follows: EV / PV = $180,000 / $202,500 = SPI of .89. Since SPI is below 1.0, your project is behind schedule.

You are working with your team to plan the next release and are noticing some gaps in the skill sets of some of your junior team members. You pair junior members with senior members but still identify the need for additional training. The project has a tight schedule but currently there is some flexibility with timelines. When is the most effective time for team members to take training?


A. As soon as possible since there is some time in the schedule.
B. Training should be taken based on the availability of the team member.
C. The Agile Coach should decide when team members should go on training.
D. Training should be done as close to the point of solution as possible.


People - Task 5 - Ensure Team is Trained
The question is simply, when is the most effective time for team members to take training, and that is as close to the point of when it is needed. If one does not utilize the skills for some time after the training, then the skill can easily be lost. The team as a whole will work together to determine the best time (not mandated by the Agile Coach).

You are leading a large infrastructure project for the IT department at your organization. You have completed all your planning and are beginning to start your build phase. You have multiple stakeholders who have a lot of influence in your organization and on this project - as this is a high visibility, highly political project involving millions of dollars. There was a similar project several years ago, but not the same scale as this one. Which statement best represents your next steps?


A. Look to lessons learned from the previous project
B. Perform a Stakeholder Analysis
C. Outsource the project
D. Perform a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment


People - Task 9 - Collaborate with Stakeholders
This question appears to have large stakeholder involvement. Since you already know you have multiple highly-influential stakeholders, you will already have completed the Stakeholder Analysis (either via the grid, cube or Salience model). So, B is not the correct answer. However, since stakeholder engagement can increase or decrease the support for this project, a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment would be the best tool to use as your next step. This will determine the engagement level of the key stakeholders, and develop strategies on how to get the correct level of engagement to support the project. While lessons learned is important and can help with managing the stakeholders for this project, the engagement is the best thing to do next.

A. Ignore it because this PMP is a friend of yours
B. Report the project manager to the PMI for unethical behavior
C. Report this activity to the stakeholders
D. Talk to this PM about the WBS to see if he can rework it to reflect actual costs on the project


People - Task 13 - Mentor Stakeholders
The first thing you should always do is try to resolve issues like this among yourselves. By working with this PM, you may be able to avoid a serious conflict. If he or she refuses to change the WBS, you have a responsibility to go to stakeholders and voice your concerns. Based on the facts in the questions, you cannot be sure it is a breach of PMI ethics.

Question: 86
Incorrect - You answered: D

During Planning, you and your team performed risk analysis for your new product. One of the risks you identified, and for which you devised a mitigation, was the possibility of a shortage of a precious metal your product requires. That shortage has now occurred, and you must implement the risk response. You realize that in order to perform the response, you will need project documents that include the risk register, risk report and the:


A. Overall risk report
B. Lessons learned register
C. Issue log
D. Risk analysis matrix


Process - Task 12 - Manage Artifacts
While it may not seem like the obvious choice, the lessons learned register can be quite useful as the lessons learned in earlier phases can be applied in later phases. The issue log is an output of Direct and Manage Project Work, as well as a common document we find under 'Project documents updates' for various processes. Answer choices A and D do not exist. Watch out for made-up names that sound right. If you know your documents, you cannot get those wrong.



______
Question: 87
Correct - You answered: D

You are in the planning stage of a large project that is scheduled to go live 18 months from now. You have determined how many teams must be established and the roles and responsibilities of the team members. The number of team members currently exceeds 100. You are trying to determine the most efficient way to utilize these team members and determine which resources will be needed at which times. Which document will you now be creating and updating to record this?


A. Org Chart
B. WBS
C. Roles and Responsibilities Matrix
D. Resource Management Plan


People - Task 6 - Build a Team
A Resource Management Plan is used, among other things, to document which resources will be used at which times. The organizational chart shows the reporting relationship of team members, the WBS shows the work breakdown (not who is performing the work). The Roles and Responsibilities Matrix shows the Roles, Authority, Responsibilities and Competencies on the project, but would not necessarily address when the resources are needed.

Question: 113
Correct - You answered: D

You are managing an agile project where many of your team members are working virtually. At the beginning of the project you identified all the tools for virtual meetings, conference calls, communicating status, reports and logging issues. Many of these tools were new to your team members and not very user friendly, which often led to problems logging into meetings and updating status in a timely manner. Team members often wondered why previous tools used on past projects were not used which led to frustration since these new tools were not intuitive. What could you have done to prevent this situation?


A. You should have arranged training for team members on the use of each of the tools before rolling them out.
B. Change is inevitable. Team members simply need time to get used to new tools.
C. You should have used the previous tools that everyone was used to .
D. You should have allowed the team to decide which tools to use.

Question: 133
Incorrect - You answered: A

You are a project manger on a multi-year transportation project for the state. You are about two-thirds complete with the project and, so far, the project has progressed well. You continue to work with your stakeholders throughout the project and they have been engaged and helpful in championing your project, identifying issues and providing recommendations. However, recently, you have noticed new stakeholders appear, which you were not expecting and have not identified. This has created some tension on the team; team members are becoming concerned a requirement may have been missed. What should you do?

A. Review your stakeholder engagement plan to ensure you are identifying and engaging stakeholders correctly.
B. Refer to project documents such as the change log, issue log and requirements documentation.
C. Review the communications management plan to determine if you have any gaps in your communicating with your stakeholders.
D. Review your project management plan as it is your overall guide for how to manage your project.


People - Task 9 - Collaborate with Stakeholders
The problem is you have not identified all the stakeholders. It is unlikely any project documents will be an input for initial stakeholder identification. However, stakeholder identification occurs throughout the project. Once the project is initially planned, more documents become available and are used throughout the project. Project documents to be considered as inputs for Identifying Stakeholders include the change log, issue log and requirements documentation. Reviewing a plan will not necessarily directly address the issue of not identifying stakeholders throughout the project (Choices A, C and D).

______
Question: 138
Correct - You answered: A

You have worked hard to establish a schedule baseline, and had calculated the critical path; however, you have been informed that actual duration information has been made available and now you want to update the schedule and determine if the critical path has changed. Activity A is 5 days, and happens before Activities B (2 days) and E (6 days). Activity C is a successor to E and B and is 1 day long. Finally, activity D, dependent on C and A will complete after 8 days. You have updated your schedule accordingly. After this schedule update, the total float is computed to be less then zero. What does this mean?

A. The project will likely complete late
B. The project will likely complete early
C. The critical path work is ahead of schedule but the other work is behind schedule
D. The most recently completed task took less time than planned


Process - Task 6 - Manage Schedule
Negative float tells you that the project is behind schedule, and the project will be late unless you can get caught up.

Which of the following processes typically occur in parallel on Agile projects?


A. Plan Quality Management and Control Quality
B. Control Quality and Validate Scope
C. Plan Quality Management and Validate Scope
D. Plan Quality Management and Manage Quality


Process - Task 7 - Manage Quality
By their nature, customers/end users are an integral part of Agile teams, working in tandem with other team members. When the team begins to verify deliverables in the Control Quality process, the customers/end users also validate/accept those deliverables at the same time, so both processes are effectively combined.

A. Tell Jack that you can adapt the project to his budgetary constraints but this will most likely affect the project scope and/or schedule.
B. Tell the sponsor that this is an Agile environment and budgets do not matter, he must have an agile mindset
C. Submit your resignation letter after you have updated LinkedIn and the Issue Log
D. Tell Jack that this is not possible in an agile project and set aside time to educate him on the methodology


Process - Task 5 - Manage Budget and Resources
Agile projects can exist in an environment with strict budgetary requirements but it will affect the project scope and schedule this should be communicated early in the project. PMBOK Guide p 234. Make sure to know the "Considerations for Agile/Adaptive Environments" paragraphs for each knowledge area

______
Question: 143
Correct - You answered: C

Which of the following is not a key benefit of identifying the majority of stakeholders as early in the project as possible?


A. Collecting more complete requirements
B. Minimizing the risk of change requests
C. Identifying which stakeholders are at the executive level of the organization
D. Ranking stakeholders in order of importance


People - Task 9 - Collaborate with Stakeholders
Answer C identifies who has high levels of formal power, though that is only part of stakeholder analysis, which is used to rank stakeholders. Other aspects of stakeholder analysis include determining interest, influence and attitude. Having a complete or near-complete list of stakeholders as early as possible helps with collecting requirements more thoroughly, since the stakeholders are the primary source of them. Having well-defined requirements also helps minimize the frequency of change requests, which can slow down the project.

You are a Team Facilitator of a software development release where you host and attend regular Scrum of Scrum meetings. During the project two teams were disagreeing about a design solution that over time escalated to a point where neither team was willing to listen to the other team. As this started hindering the progress of the project you decided to bring in an Agile Coach and you worked with the coach and the teams to help resolve the problem. The solution turned out to be something very simple and the two teams started working together again. Which of the following documents would you update next in this situation?


A. Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix
B. Risk Register
C. Conflict Management Plan
D. Lessons Learned


People - Task 1 - Manage Conflict
The best answer here would be to update the lessons learned register since after a lot of back and forth the solution turned out to be a simple one. You want to make sure this does not happen again. There is no issue with Stakeholder Engagement (both teams are still supportive of the project!). A risk is an uncertainty (this is an issue). There is no document called Conflict Management Plan.

A. Request the contract
B. Request the basis of estimates
C. Request Sponsor Approval
D. Request a Triangular distribution


Process - Task 11 - Manage Procurement
A basis of estimates provides an itemized list of everything used to determine the cost. It will included estimates, formulas, assumptions, material, etc. This will allow you see how they came up with the price. Requesting the contract will not tell you how the price was determined, nor would a triangular distribution. Requesting Sponsor approval will not solve the problem or answer the question.



______
Question: 152
Correct - You answered: C

Project managers must be aware of many motivational theories. Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs sets forth which of the following propositions?


A. The strongest motivation for work is to provide for physiological needs.

You are the Project Manager for an organization that embraces changes to the business environment. More than likely what type of organization do you work for?


A. Functional
B. Weak Matrix
C. Tight Matrix
D. Project-oriented


Business Environment - Task 4 - Support Org Change
Most likely, this would describe Projectized. That is not to say that Functional or Weak Matrix does not embrace change. Both Functional and Weak Matrix normally refer to ongoing operations type work with few projects, whereas Projectized organizations only work on projects. Projects are all about change, and so that would be the best answer. Remember you will not always get perfect answers (or perfect questions for that matter), you have to choose the best out of an ambiguous situation. Tight matrix refers to the team being co-located (not a type of organization). PMI Authorized PMP Exam Prep Student Guide/ Page 275

You are an experienced project manager working in the pharmaceutical industry. You are leading a project for a cutting-edge medication which is revolutionary. You are monitoring the status of the project work to update the project budget and manage changes to the cost baseline. So far things appear to be progressing well, but you are starting to but concerned with work being done by a new vendor. Which output would you be most concerned with?

A. Work performance information and cost forecasts
B. Budget reserves and cost estimates
C. Work performance reports and earned value management
D. Cost estimates and aggregation


Process - Task 5 - Manage Budget and Resources
The process described is Control Costs and the outputs are documented in A. This is one of the more technical processes to understand for the PMP exam as it includes the earned value tools and techniques. Budget reserves are monitored during the Monitor Risks process. Earned value management is a technique and not an output. Cost aggregation is when you add all of your individual cost estimates together and is done to determine what the project budget will be.

Question: 157
Incorrect - You answered: C

You are conducting risk management activities on your project. You are starting to develop risk responses to some of the higher priority risks. You have identified the potential for hurricane damage due to the fact you are building a new facility in a known hurricane zone during hurricane season. If a hurricane should occur, the damage to the building, and subsequent repairs, will push out your project end date quite substantially. You decide to move the location of the new facility to a different area that does not experience hurricanes at all. What type of risk response is this?

A. Avoidance
B. Exploiting
C. Mitigation
D. Transfer


Process - Task 3 - Manage Risks
Choice A is the correct answer since you are completely avoiding the risk by moving the facility to a different location which does not experience hurricanes. Choice B is incorrect because exploiting is a response for a positive risk (opportunity) - this is a threat. Mitigation (Choice C) would decrease the probability and/or impact. Transfer (Choice D) involves a contract or an insurance policy, which is not mentioned in the question.


______
Question: 158
Correct - You answered: C

You are working on outlining procedures for staff acquisition and release, training, rewards and compliance as they pertain to your project team. Where will you document these procedures?

One of your team members has told you that the team is a little behind schedule and one of the reasons is that the daily standup meetings are taking way too long. You attend the next daily standup meeting and notice that every single team member is discussing what they accomplished the day before, what they plan in accomplishing today which then leads to a detailed discussion of their issues and risks. What advice would you give to the Team Facilitator?

A. Regarding risks and issues, the daily standups should be limited to identifying them only, any discussion of resolution should be taken off-line.
B. The meeting should be more structured so they can be conducted more efficiently.
C. Advise the team facilitator that not all team members need to give their updates. If only team members with issues give updates, then the meeting will be much more efficient.
D. The Team Facilitator is performing fine. If there are issues and problems,         then these need to be discussed and fixed.


People - Task 7 - Remove Obstacles
The daily standups should be attended by all team members and address what work was accomplished yesterday, what is going to be worked on today and what impediments there are. These impediments should be taken offline, not discussed at the meeting itself. The standup should be no more than 15 minutes.

You have taken over a project from a colleague who has moved to another department. One of the first issues you need to address is the concern of stakeholders not receiving timely reporting, leading them to make decisions based on faulty information. To understand stakeholder expectations best, the first thing you should do is:


A. Ask the sponsor to communicate with key stakeholders
B. Consult the Communications Management Plan
C. Call an emergency meeting with key stakeholders
D. Consult the Stakeholder EngagementPlan


Process - Task 12 - Manage Artifacts
While this is an important issue, this not an emergency and there is no reason to call an emergency meeting or to involve the sponsor. The Communications management plan will provide information about stakeholders' needs, requirements, and expectations. There is no such document as the stakeholder management plan, this is an excellent example of a distractor answer loosely referring to the Stakeholder Engagement Plan.

You are hosting a retrospective meeting and there are other stakeholders attending in addition to your team and the Product Owner. You notice that some attendees are listening attentively and occasionally taking the odd note. Most likely these stakeholders will fall into which category of the ESVP model?


A. Explorer
B. Shopper
C. Vacationer
D. Prisoner


People - Task 4 - Empower Team
Since these stakeholders are listening attentively it means they have some interest. They are occasionally taking the odd note which means they are happy to just learn one thing from the meeting and so they would more likely be a Shopper. An explorer would more likely be taking plenty of notes. A vacationer is just happy to get away from their day to day work and may not be very attentive. A prisoner just does not want to be there at all and will less likely be attentive or taking notes. https://www.scrum.as/academy.php?show=1&chapter=15

Jackie is a project manager working with a team of more than 30 people. One of her subordinates tells her that the team members at the lowest level are lazy, and that they need to be supervised more closely. Jackie responds that the workers are as committed to the project as she is, that they are ambitious and self-disciplined and do not need to be watched every minute of the day. Instead, Jackie proposes that each worker should be given more responsibility. Which type of manager is Jackie?


A. Hygiene factor manager
B. Theory Z manager
C. Theory Y manager
D. Theory X manager


People - Task 2 - Lead a Team
According to McGregor's Theory of X and Y (but not Z), Jackie is a Theory Y manager. She trusts her employees to be self-motivated and believes that they do not need to be watched every minute. Theory X managers feel the way the subordinate does in this question -- they feel that workers are lazy and need to be watched constantly. Theory Z is a management theory where creating the expectation of having the job for life motivates them to perform their best.

You are managing a 14-month mission-critical project for your company with a limited number of labor resources. The project end date is set by top management and can't be moved. To complete all planned deliverables on time, the team will have to work many overtime hours each week and some weekends. What is the best way to minimize the risk that team members will burn out and quit the project prematurely or possibly even leave the company?


A. Add a threat risk to the Risk Register, and closely monitor the stress levels of the team for any signs of burnout.
B. Add an opportunity risk to the Risk Register, and adopt an exploit strategy that provides positive rewards and recognition for working overtime hours.
C. Add a threat risk to the Risk Register, and adopt a mitigation strategy that provides positive rewards and recognition for working overtime hours.
D. Add a threat risk to the Risk Register, and adopt an avoid strategy by signing a Time &amp; Materials contract with a consulting firm that can provide staff augmentation on short notice to replace any team member who quits.


People - Task 2 - Lead a Team
While you will certainly do answer A, the best choice is C since it will set expectations of rewards and recognitions with the team up front, as it will be part of the Resource Management Plan. Answer D might work, but it does little to promote developing an effective team and can discourage team harmony and unity. Answer B is false since this scenario describes a threat risk, not an opportunity risk.

Your project selection committee is considering four projects. Project A's NPV is positive, it has an ERR of 14%, and the payback period is 21 months. Project B's NPV is negative, it has an ERR of 9%, and the payback period is 16 months. Project C's NPV is positive, it has an ERR of 16%, and the payback period is 18 months. Project D's NPV is negative, with an ERR of 16%, and the payback period is 13 months. Which project should you choose?


A. Project A
B. Project B
C. Project C
D. Project D


Process - Task 9 - Integrate Planning
Payback period is the least precise of all cash flow calculations, so you shouldn't give this a lot of consideration if NPV is positive and ERR is greater than 0. Since Project B and Project D both have negative NPV, they shouldn't be chosen. Project C has a higher IRR value than Project A and should be the project you choose.

A. Define Activities
B. Define Scope
C. Create Work Breakdown Structure
D. Develop Project Management Plan


Process - Task 8 - Manage Scope
The WBS is used to break down the project's deliverables into smaller components, which serves several purposes. First and foremost, it ensures that all work items are accounted for. It is a useful tool to use throughout project planning because it will help facilitate work assignments, cost estimating and tracking, identification of risks, etc. The lowest level of the WBS includes "work package" items. These packages will then be broken down further into discrete activities, but that is a separate process belonging to the Schedule Management knowledge group (Define Activities).

You are the project manager for an up and coming organization. This project is the first of its kind for the organization and the market. Your sponsor is excited and so are the shareholders who have invested in the company. During a planned review of processes, you hope to identify activities that bring no value to the project. The Sponsor also reviewed the project charter to refresh their memory of the scope of the project to support your efforts. Which statement best identifies the current situation?


A. You are being audited by the Sponsor to ensure compliance to the project charter
B. You are conducting an analysis of the process
C. The quality department is reviewing your processes followed by formal acceptance of the results
D. You are conducting a comparison of the project charter to executed work to ensure only work identified in charter is completed


Business Environment - Task 2 - Evaluate/ Deliver Benefits
Do not let the question mislead you. Any information about the charter is irrelevant. You are conducting a process analysis which identifies opportunities for process improvements. It also identifies non-value-added activities and existing problems. If you answered A, you were caught by the red herring of the Sponsor reviewing the charter.
